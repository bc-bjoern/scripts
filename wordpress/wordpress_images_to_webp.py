WordPress Image Conversion Script

This script connects to a WordPress database, retrieves image attachments,
converts them to WebP format, and updates the database with the new paths and metadata.

Usage:
1. Ensure that the script is configured with the correct database and file paths.
2. Run the script to process image attachments in the database.
